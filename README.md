Hello!

  My name is Sean Louis Dela Cruz, and I am currently a junior in college, going for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
  
  I'm interested in various things, but never really stay on one topic. I like learning new things when it comes to the world of programming, and I hope to expand my knowledge
  even more!
  
  I'm still somewhat new to the online comp sci community as I never dabbled in Github or the sort, but I'm getting by alright.
  
  My projects are a place where they keep me motivated to keep programming and expanding my knowledge.
  
  If I can think of other things to put here, I'll do so.
              
              Thanks for reading,
                        Sean
