Hello!

  My name is Sean Louis Dela Cruz, and I am currently a senior in college, going for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
  
  I'm interested in various things, but never really stay on one topic. I like constantly learning new things from Web dev to software engineering to robotics. I'm definitely not that great in any field, though.
  
  My projects are a place where they keep me motivated to keep programming and expanding my knowledge.
  
  If I can think of other things to put here, I'll do so.
              
              Thanks for reading,
                        Sean
